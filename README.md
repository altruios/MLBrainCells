# MLBrainCells
 this is a really rough draft

this was just to see if I understood neural networks:

I'm updating this as I go - but currently I'm working on back propagation.

documentation incomming.

Brain() is the constructor - it takes 2 numbers for columns and rows generated and an option object, that hasn't been implemented fully implemented.
it sets all activations weights and bias randomly,


pressing numbers randomly changes the bias of all cells where cell.generation == number,
pressing b(lowercase) and on through the alphabet randomly changes the weights between the cell generations.
clicking adds a random Weight/activation pair to the first generation, and propagates the value changes forward.


this really is just testing and not super serial.
